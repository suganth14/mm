Simple Interest:
  Value of investment at time t V(t) = (1+tr)P
Compound interest:
  V(t) = P.(1+ r/m)^tm
Cont. Compunding:
  V(t) = P.e^rt
EMI:
  PA(r,n) = (1 - (1+r)^-n)/r
  Installment amt = P/PA(r,n)
  Interest paid = P*r
  Capital repaid = Installment amount - Interest paid
  Outstanding balance = Outstanding balance - Capital repaid
